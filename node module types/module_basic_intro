module types in node js

there are 2 types of module
1. Built in modules
    - these are included by default so we can use without install, just import  them and use

    some built in models and use
    - os    : provide information about operating system
    - PATH  : provide uitlity functions for working with file paths
                Join path segments together
                Tell if a path is absolute or not
                Get the last portion/segment of a path
                Get the file extension from a path, and much more!

    - FS()    : file system operations like reading and writing files.         
                Reading a file (sync or async way)
                Writing to a file (sync or async way)
                Deleting a file
                Reading the contents of a director
                Renaming a file
                Watching for changes in a file, and much more
            
        Synchronous Approach: 
        - create a file and write the data to it in a blocking manner,
        - means that NodeJS waits for the creation and write operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code. 
        - If an error occurs during this process, it throws an exception that must be caught using try...catch.
        
        Asynchronous Approach:
        - create and write data to a file in a non-blocking manner,
        - means that NodeJS does not wait for the write operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code.
        -  it takes a callback function that gets called once the entire process is completed. If an error occurs during the write operation, the error object is passed to the callback function.


            some functions of fs are 
                -fs.mkdir(), // in here fs is variable that store fs pakage
                -fs.writeFile(),
                fs.readFile(),
                  
        about {encoding:'utf-8'} that used as parameter in readFile()
            -used to specify the character encoding 
            -used to interpret the file data.
            - By default, if no encoding parameter is provided, the method returns a raw buffer.
            - If the readFile() method is called without encoding parameter, result will be:
            - <Buffer 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 73 6f 6d 65 20 64 61 74 61 20 69 6e 20 61 20 66 69 6c 65>

    - HTTP  : create HTTP servers

2. External modules
    - these are created by other developers, not included by default so we have to install to use
